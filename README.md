## - reflection: 
In this workshop, I learned how to create a table in p5.js, as well as how to integrate images and link them with a CSV file for better data visualization. I also explored inserting text and adding a select box to enhance interactivity. The theme was based on my own data, reflecting my mood during weeks 1-5, with the mood connected to images, providing a clear and intuitive presentation. A new feature I experimented with was adjusting the font style, using textAlign(CENTER) and textFont('serif') to refine the overall design.
To build on this project, I want to include a feature where users can input text into a box and see it displayed dynamically within the visualization. This could allow for personalized annotations or mood reflections, making the experience more interactive and meaningful.
